         </p><h2 id="h3">1.Khan Academy</h2>
         <br>
         <p id="p4">
         Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computing, history, art history, economics, and more, including K-14 and test preparation (SAT, Praxis, LSAT) content. We focus on skill mastery to help learners establish strong foundations, so there's no limit to what they can learn next!
         Khan Academy's website aims to provide a free high-quality education to anyone, built on videos hosted on YouTube. The website is meant to be used as a supplement to the videos, because it includes other features such as progress tracking, practice exercises,and teaching tools.The material can also be accessed through mobile applications.The videos enable students to acquire knowledge at their own learning speed according to the concept of mastery learning. They are therefore used by teachers to teach according to the principle of Flipped Classroom.

         The videos display a recording of drawings on an electronic blackboard, which are similar to the style of a teacher giving a lecture. The narrator describes each drawing and how they relate to the material being taught.Furthermore, throughout the lessons, users can earn badges and energy points, which can be displayed on their profiles. Non-profit groups have distributed offline versions of the videos to rural areas in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Videos range from all subjects covered in school and for all grades from kindergarten up through high school. The Khan Academy website also hosts content from educational YouTube channels and organizations such as Crash Course and the Museum of Modern Art.It also provides online courses for preparing for standardized tests, including the SAT, AP Chemistry, Praxis Core and MCAT and released LSAT preparation lessons in 2018.They also have a collaboration with independent chemists, which are mentioned in their, "Meet the chemistry professional". Khan Academy has also supported Code.org's Hour of Code, providing coding lessons on its website.

         </p><h2 id="h4">2.Coursera</h2>
         <br>
         <p id="p5">
         Coursera is a for-profit U.S.-based massive open online course provider founded in 2012 by Stanford University computer science professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller.Coursera works with universities and other organizations to offer online courses, certifications, and degrees in a variety of subjects.As of 2017, Coursera offers complete master's degrees. They first started with a Master's in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MSIE) from HEC Paris and a Master's of Accounting (iMSA) from the University of Illinois but have moved on to offer a Master of Computer Science in Data Science and Master of Business Administration (iMBA), both from University of Illinois. Also as part of their MBA programs, there are some courses which are offered separately, which are included in the curriculum of specific MBAs when enrolling in classes such as their digital marketing courses.


         Google, IBM, Meta and other well-known companies, launched various courses for professional certificates, allowing students to fill the workforce in various sectors, such as data analytics, IT support, digital marketing, UX design, project management, and Data science. According to Google, their courses are equivalent to 4 year degrees. They also offered 100,000 scholarships.Google and its 20+ partners will accept those certificates as 4-year degree equivalent.Some people find Coursera's pricing and fees confusing. Many of its courses are free to students—over 2,900 free courses as of 2023. The free courses (also called "auditing a course") do not include a certificate of completion or grades or any other instructor feedback. A free course can be "upgraded" to the paid version of a course, which includes instructor's feedback and grades for the submitted assignments, and (if the student gets a passing grade) a certificate of completion. Other Coursera courses, projects, specializations, etc. cannot be audited—they are only available in paid versions. Many of them begin with a 7-day free trial.

         <p id="p5">
         If your university’s online library is not the best, you might be struggling to find sources for your college essays and papers. This is where Google Scholar comes in. Instead of using Google’s regular search where news articles and other posts will inevitably spring up, this tool allows you to search for scholarly literature only. You can find reliable information from peer-reviewed scientific papers quickly and easily. You might bump into some pay-walled content, but Google Scholar is still one of the best free online resources for college students.

         Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites.
